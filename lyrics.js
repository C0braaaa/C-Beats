            I don't wanna lose my mind
            I don't wanna lose myself
            Tell me if I crossed a line
            I ain't tryin' to hurt myself
            Didn't want to call your name
            Only got myself to blame, oh yeah
            In my world, in my mind, always runnin' out of time
            In my love, in my heart, you're the only kryptonite
            But I
            But I wait for you, still I wait for you
            Yeah, it feels so good, I might just lose my mind
            No question if it's wrong or right
            Ain't no way to tell which way it's gonna go, yeah
            But it feels so good, I might just lose my mind
            No question if it's wrong or right
            And now it's too late, no way to take it slow, oh
            Yeah
            Bounce back when bottles is on me
            I'm pushin' a new pen, rewritin' the story
            Hello to my old ways, goodbye to the nosebleeds
            You fightin' to stay here, you probably ODin'
            Ain't finna pop for no reason
            I don't throw shots, I run legions
            I been goin' over the top where no queen been
            Die with no regrets, this is my season
            Itch to pull trigger, gift that keep givin'
            None to wrap up, I ripped a new ribbon
            They wanted to catch up, wanted my good riddance
            You saw me at rock bottom, you wanted a new winner
            I paved the way for 'em
            Take the pain, doubled it, put it in waveform
            Safe to say trouble ain't what you was made for
            Keepin' the rang on
            I told 'em all game on the minute I came on
            Yeah, it feels so good, I might just lose my mind
            No question if it's wrong or right
            Ain't no way to tell which way it's gonna go, yeah (yeah)

            Back when I was a kid
            My mom told me how to let go from everyhing
            "Find your inner peace" that's what she told me
            'Cause nothing, nothing comes for free
            Whenever I feel like I'm all alone
            I'll find the glory deep inside my soul
            And I'll fight for my passion in life
            Give everything I have in me
            And break into the dark
            I'll break into the dark
            I'll give eveything I have and everything I had
            I'm one step closer to the light
            I'll break into the dark
            I'll break into the dark
            Deep underneath your skin
            There lies a new sin, that's life we're living in
            But I'll be standing strong in all the fights I've lost
            'Cause that's, that's just who we are
            Whenever I feel like I'm all alone
            I'll find the glory deep inside my soul
            And I'll fight for my passion in life
            Give everything I have in me
            And break into the dark
            I'll break into the dark
            I'll give everyhing I haveand everyhing I had
            I'm one step closer to the light
            I'll break into the dark
            I'll break into the dark
            No, I'm not gonna give up
            Oh, no, not gonna give up
            I'm gonna give it my all
            Rise above the ground
            No more looking down and shine
            And break into the dark
            I'll break into the dark, oh
            I'll give everything I have and everything I had
            I'm one step closer to the light

            It was just two lovers
            Sittin' in the car, listening to Blonde
            Fallin' for each other
            Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
            No Donald Glover
            Missed call from my mother
            Like, "Where you at tonight?" Got no alibi
            I was all alone with the love of my life
            She's got glitter for skin
            My radiant beam in the night
            I don't need no light to see you
            Shine
            It's your golden hour (oh)
            You slow down time
            In your golden hour (oh)
            We were just two lovers
            Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
            Burnin' through the summer
            Radio on blast, make the moment last
            She got solar power
            Minutes feel like hours
            She knew she was the baddest, can you even imagine
            Fallin' like I did?
            For the love of my life
            She's got glow on her face
            A glorious look in her eyes
            My angel of light
            I was all alone with the love of my life
            She's got glitter for skin
            My radiant beam in the night
            I don't need no light to see you
            Shine
            It's your golden hour (oh)

            Callin' you now, but you're not pickin' up

            You're callin' me now, but I can't pick up

            I saw the wildflowers dying
            As we froze in the winter
            Lost my clothes in the water
            Feel the sand between my toes

            Put our hands on the lions

            We slowed down, slow down (slow down, slow down)

            And I swear the magnolias flashed a smile (flashed a smile)
            And that’s when I caught me hoping you’d stay a while (stay a whiiiile)

            Baby, I’d give up anything to travel inside your mind
            Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
            My daddy taught me to choose ‘em wisely but you don’t have to try
            Coz baby I fall in love every summertime

            25, man we’re missing church
            Laugh ‘bout everyone we’re hating at work
            Dinner with your sister and the jokes kinda hurt 
            Cry the way home and you’re putting me first, oh
            Yeah, you just always know what to say

            We’re strolling down the boulevard, and dancing under streetlights (oh the lights)
            Every year we get older and I’m still on your side (oh IIIII)

            Baby, I’d give up anything to travel inside your mind
            Baby, I fall in love again come every summertime
            My daddy taught me to choose ‘em wisely but you don’t have to try
            Coz baby I fall in love every summertime

            Every day is summertime
            Every day is summertime
            Every day is summertime 
            with you

            I walked across an empty land
            I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
            I felt the earth beneath my feet
            Sat by the river and it made me complete
            Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
            I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
            So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
            I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
            I came across a fallen tree
            I felt the branches of it looking at me
            Is this the place we used to love?
            Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
            Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
            I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
            So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
            I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
            And if you have a minute, why don't we go
            Talk about it somewhere only we know?
            This could be the end of everything
            So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
            Somewhere only we know
            Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
            I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
            So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
            I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
            And if you have a minute, why don't we go
            Talk about it somewhere only we know?
            This could be the end of everything
            So, why don't we go?
            So, why don't we go?
            Ooh, oh-oh
            Ah, oh
            This could be the end of everything
            So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?

            I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
            All of my change, I spent on you
            Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
            Where are the plans we made for two?
            Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember the people we used to be
            It's even harder to picture that you're not here next to me
            You say it's too late to make it, but is it too late to try?
            And in our time that you wasted, all of our bridges burned down
            I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
            Now I'm paralyzed
            Still stuck in that time when we called it love
            But even the sun sets in paradise
            I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
            All of my change, I spent on you
            Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
            Where are the plans we made for two?
            If happy-ever-afters did exist
            I would still be holding you like this
            All those fairy tales are full of shit
            One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh, yeah
            You turned your back on tomorrow 'cause you forgot yesterday
            I gave you my love to borrow, but you just gave it away
            You can't expect me to be fine (oh), I don't expect you to care (yeah)
            I know I said it before, but all of our bridges burned down
            I've wasted my nights, you turned out the lights
            Now I'm paralyzed (oh)
            Still stuck in that time when we called it love
            But even the sun sets in paradise
            I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
            All of my change, I spent on you (oh-oh)

            And all those fairy tales are full of shit
            One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (uh)
            Now I'm at a payphone
            Man, fuck that shit
            I be out spendin' all this money while you sittin' 'round
            Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
            Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
            And all of my cars start with the push of a button
            Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
            Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
            Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
            Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
            Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
            So you talk about who you see at the top
            Or what you could've saw, but sad to say, it's over for
            Phantom pulled up, valet opened doors
            Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
            Now it's me who they want
            So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you (yeah)
            I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
            All of my change, I spent on you (whoo)
            Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong (yeah)
            Where are the plans we made for two? (Yeah, yeah)
            If happy-ever-afters did exist (oh, yeah)

            Ain't no way that I'm sitting around, it's now or never, I'm picking it first (Yeah, I'm picking it first)
            You can't tell me that I won't make it, knew that I had this gift since birth (I knew)

            Still came far cah I put in the work (Yeah, yeah)
            Painting a picture when I write lyrics, don't call me a rapper, I'm really an artist
            This weren't by chance or luck, I took one shot and I hit my target (One shot)
            I'm not even yet in my prime, I'm not at a hundred yet, I'm still charging (Still charging)
            They don't wanna see me win, but I know in the end, I'm winning regardless

            Sleepless nights, I was up in the stu', up in the booth tryna make me a hit
            Even when I was feeling low, man, I kept on going, I weren't gon' quit
            I can't wait for the day that I make it, next in line, man, I feel like a king
            My time will come, I just gotta be patient, keep on pushing and take these risks
            I made raps off putting my pain on tracks, grinding hard tryna to see more plaques (Plaques)
            I've been going harder than ever, I don't have time to sit and relax (I don't)
            I've been putting in countless hours, I still not near where I wanna be at (Not yet)
            This year, I'ma prove them wrong, they said that I can't, but I know that I can

            If I could do it, then why can't you? Huh, get up and make it work
